**Build, train, and deploy end-to-end machine learning and deep learning pipelines**

## What is this book about?
This book will help you explore how to implement different well-known machine learning algorithms with various C++ frameworks and libraries. You will cover basic to advanced machine learning concepts with practical and easy to follow examples. By the end of the book, you will be able to build various machine learning models with ease.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Explore how to load and preprocess various data types to suitable C++ data structures
* Employ key machine learning algorithms with various C++ libraries
* Understand the grid-search approach to find the best parameters for a machine learning model
* Implement an algorithm for filtering anomalies in user data using Gaussian distribution
* Improve collaborative filtering to deal with dynamic user preferences
* Use C++ libraries and APIs to manage model structures and parameters
* Implement a C++ program to solve image classification tasks with LeNet architecture

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
class Network {
  public:
    Network(const std::string& snapshot_path,
            const std::string& synset_path,
            torch::DeviceType device_type);
    std::string Classify(const at::Tensor& image);
  private:
    torch::DeviceType device_type_;
    Classes classes_;
    torch::jit::script::Module model_;
};

```

# Fork information
This is a personal fork where I (MagneticMartian) am primarily adding notes and making, potentially minor, edits that to the repo in order to make it more understandable to myself. Hopefully someone stumbling on this will find that to be the case as well.
